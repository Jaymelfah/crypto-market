# CRYTPO-MARKET
In this project I built a metrics webapp using the CoinGeckoApi. This application displays a list of ranking cryptocurrencies
and allows you to search in the home page any of your favorite crypto coins. When users click one cryptocurrency they will be able to see things like CoinMarketCap rank, Current value, Symbol, price changes from 60d to 1h, and more.
